### Jump right in on codepen!

You can use react-vis directly on [codepen](https://codepen.io/ubervisualization/pen/BZOeZB) (or equivalent).  
Each published version of react-vis is accessible via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com).

Add react files, and a link to the latest react-vis version - such as https://unpkg.com/react-vis@1.6.7/dist/dist.min.js.

But you can simply just use that [pen](https://codepen.io/ubervisualization/pen/BZOeZB) and take it from there.
