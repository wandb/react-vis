## Series

The library supports several types of series:

* [ArcSeries](arc-series.md) for radial arcs such as might be found in pie charts.
* [AreaSeries](area-series.md) for area charts;
* [BarSeries](bar-series.md) for discrete bar charts, covers (covers HorizontalBarSeries and VerticalBarSeries);
* [ContourSeries](contour-series.md) for making contour density plots;
* [HeatmapSeries](heatmap-series.md) for heat maps.
* [HexbinSeries](hexbin-series.md) for aggregate hexagonal binning heatmaps.
* [LabelSeries](label-series.md) for adding annotations to charts
* [LineMarkSeries](line-mark-series.md) is a shorthand to place marks (e.g. circles) on lines;
* [LineSeries](line-series.md) for lines;
* [MarkSeries](mark-series.md) for scatterplots;
* [PolygonSeries](polygon-series.md) for arbitrary SVG shapes
* [RectSeries](rect-series.md) for arbitrary histograms and other continuous variable boxes. (covers HorizontalRectSeries and VerticalRectSeries)

Each series provides following API:

#### data

Type: `Array<Object>`

Array of data for the series.

#### x

Type: `number|Object`

Exact X position of all series points in pixels or a series object.

#### y (optional)

Type: `number|Object`

Exact Y position of all series points in pixels or a series object.

#### color (optional)

Type: `string|Object`

Exact color for all series points or a series object.

#### size (optional)

Type: `number|Object`

Exact size for all series points in pixels or a series object.

#### opacity (optional)

Type: `number|Object`

Exact opacity for all series points in pixels or a series object.

#### className (optional)

Type: `string`

Provide an additional class name for the series.

#### onNearestX (optional)

Type: `function(value, info)`

A callback function which is triggered each time when the mouse pointer gets close to some X value.
Callback is triggered with two arguments. `value` is the data point, `info` object has following properties:
- `innerX` is the left position of the value;
- `index` is the index of the data point in the array of data;
- `event` is the event object.

#### onValueMouseOver (optional)

Type: `function(d, info)`

`mouseover` event handler for the elements corresponding separate data points `d` is a data point, `info` is an object with the only `event` property.
**NOTE**: This event handler is *not* triggered for AreaSeries and LineSeries.

#### onValueMouseOut (optional)

Type: `function(d, info)`

`mouseout` event handler for the elements corresponding separate data points. `d` is a data point, `info` is an object with the only `event` property.
**NOTE**: This event handler is *not* triggered for AreaSeries and LineSeries.

#### onValueClick (optional)

Type: `function(d, info)`

`click` event handler for the elements corresponding separate data points. `d` is a data point, `info` is an object with the only `event` property.
**NOTE**: This event handler is *not* triggered for AreaSeries and LineSeries.

#### onSeriesMouseOver (optional)

Type: `function(info)`

`mouseover` event handler for the entire series. Received `info` object as argument with the only `event` property.

#### onSeriesMouseOut (optional)

Type: `function(info)`

`mouseout` event handler for the entire series. Received `info` object as argument with the only `event` property.

#### onSeriesClick (optional)

Type: `function(info)`

`click` event handler for the entire series. Received `info` object as argument with the only `event` property.

#### style (optional)

Type: `object`

An object which holds CSS properties that will be applied to the SVG element(s) rendered by the series. This allows you to style series beyond the other explicitly defined properties and without having to use CSS classnames and stylesheets. For instance, you can set the stroke-linejoin style of a line series to "round":
```jsx
<LineSeries
  data={data}
  style={{strokeLinejoin: "round"}}
/>
```
LineMark series is a composite series, and as such, it's possible to separate style instructions for the line and the mark part by putting them under a "line" and a "mark" property respectively:

```jsx
<LineMarkSeries
  data={data}
  style={{
  	// affect both the line and the mark part
  	stroke: "red",
  	line: {
  	  // affects just the line series
  	  strokeWidth: 2
  	},
  	mark: {
  	  // affects just the mark series
  	  strokeWidth: 4
  	}
  }}
/>
```

Note that style information passed through the style property will override those passed through props.
```jsx
<MarkSeries
  data={data}
  /// all the points are red
  style={{fill: "red"}}
/>
```

#### animation (optional)
See the [XYPlot](xy-plot.md)'s `animation` section for more information.

#### stack (optional)

Type: `Boolean`

Default: `false`

Opt-in for stacking series and mix stacked and non-stacked series in a single chart. If all series have the `stack` prop set to `false` (which is default behaviour), they will all be considered stackable. Otherwise if at least two of the series have the `stack` prop set to `true`, they will be stacked together and the other series will be considered non stackable.
See the [XYPlot](xy-plot.md)'s `stackBy` section for more information.
